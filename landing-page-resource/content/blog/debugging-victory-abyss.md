# ✅ Debugging Victory: Escaping the Slug Abyss

## 🕳️ The Abyss

For 50 days, **Reltroner.com** was haunted by a persistent bug:

---

Error: Route "/[slug]" used `params.slug`. 
`params` should be awaited before using its properties.

---

It seemed small...  
But it broke dynamic routing, metadata, and SEO rendering.  
It became known internally as **“The Slug Abyss.”**

---

## 🧪 Symptoms

- Page failed to load at dynamic routes.
- Metadata wouldn’t render properly.
- TypeScript and JavaScript conflict in `.jsx`.
- Internal feeling: frustration, helplessness, burnout.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

In **Next.js 14+ App Router**,  
`params` must be awaited inside dynamic functions like `generateMetadata` or `page()`.

But most tutorials didn’t mention this breaking change.  
Debugging became a spiritual war.

---

## ⚔️ Breakthrough

On **Day 50**, after tracing file trees, builds, and runtime structure…

The solution was **simply to await** `params` inside `.jsx` —  
and NOT write TypeScript annotations in JSX files.

---

> 
> // ✅ Working Fix
> export default async function Page({ params }) {
>   const { slug } = await params;
>   ...
> }
> 

---

The moment this was fixed, the site compiled flawlessly.  
**The darkness lifted.**

---

## 🧠 Reflection

This wasn’t just a fix. It was a **rite of passage.**

> Every real builder must pass through an abyss they can’t solve quickly.  
> It forces mastery, patience, and deep understanding.

---

## 📜 Legacy

- This bug will forever be remembered in the studio’s changelog.
- It marked the official closing of “Bug Abyss Era.”
- It proved: **Reltroner.com is not built on trends, but trials.**
